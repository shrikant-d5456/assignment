            About Dr. Jennifer Hahm
          </h1>

            Finding time and opportunities to care for ourselves can be incredibly challenging in today's busy and demanding world.
            I believe therapy offers a dedicated space for self-care, providing the support and tools needed to improve this essential practice.
            Therapy can help individuals identify and clarify their goals, values, and the various elements that contribute to their well-being,
            recognizing that these aspects vary from person to person.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed mt-4 space-y-4 text-[#7e7e6b] font-sans font-light tracking-tight">
            I am dedicated to supporting this journey by offering active listening, psychological knowledge, empathy, compassion,
            and insights into behavioral patterns and tendencies. I hold a masterâ€™s degree in Clinical Psychology from the Michigan School of Psychology (2012)
            and a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from Western Michigan University (2018). My experience spans therapy and psychological assessment in psychiatric
            inpatient units, academic medical centers, universities, and outpatient practice settings.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed mt-4 space-y-4 text-[#7e7e6b] font-sans font-light tracking-tight">
            My therapeutic approach is primarily psychodynamic and humanistic, enriched by influences from positive psychology, existentialism,
            family systems theory, acceptance and commitment concepts, and mindfulness practices.
